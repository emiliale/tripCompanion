# Trip Companion - an application that facilitates travel planning


## Features

An application that facilitates travel planning - focuses mainly 
on providing a tool to browse attractions in any city, select the ones the user intends to visit and automatically create an optimal route between them. An important convenience is the information on the time needed to move from one place to another, as well as the distance between them.
In order to plan a new trip, the user can 
define its duration, route and participants. The participants, other users system, once added, are given the same access to the trip as its creator. Assigned routes, on the other hand, can be either created from scratch or selected from ready-made proposals. The system allows the user to have full control over routes and trips, and they can be modified or deleted at any time. Thanks to the fact that they are also stored in memory, the user can at any time review archived trips and see the place visited, so the the application also acts as a travel diary. An additional functionality is showing statistics on user activity. Graphs and figures illustrating information about the total distance traveled, the number of visited countries, or continents can be a motivation for the traveler.
